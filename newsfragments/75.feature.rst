Incompatible change: if you use ``yield`` inside a Trio fixture, and
the ``yield`` gets cancelled (for example, due to a background task
crashing), then the ``yield`` will now raise :exc:`trio.Cancelled`.
See :ref:`cancel-yield` for details. Also, in this same case,
pytest-trio will now reliably mark the test as failed, even if the
fixture doesn't go on to raise an exception.
